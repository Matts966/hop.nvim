-- Generate the next permutation.
--
-- term_keys is the terminal key set, seq_keys is the sequence key set and perm is the permutation for which we want
-- the next one.
--
-- The way this works is by incrementing a permutation as long it its terminal key has a next available key. A sequence
-- key is a key in the last ¼ part of the initial key set. For instance, for keys = "abcdefghijklmnop", "mnop" is the
-- last ¼ part, so those keys will be used as sequence keys. The invariant is that, terminal sequences cannot share
-- their last key with non-terminal sequences on the same level. The following are then not possible (given the example
-- keys from above):
--
-- - "a", "ab": not possible because even though "b" is okay, "a" is terminal for the first sequence, so it cannot be
--   used in the second.
-- - "a", "ma", "mb", mc": okay, as "a" is not shared on the same level.
-- - "pnac": without even going any further, this sequence is not possible as "a" is only used in terminal sequences, so
--   this "pnac" sequence would collide with the correct "pna" sequence.
--
-- Yet an another – easier – way to picture the idea is that any key from the terminal key set can only appear at the end
-- of sequence, and any key from the sequence key set can only appear before a terminal key in a sequence.
